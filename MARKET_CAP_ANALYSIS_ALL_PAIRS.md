## 🎯 IMPORTANT INSIGHT

### Why Market Cap Didn't Matter

Even the **largest, most liquid pairs** (BTC, ETH, BNB) were skipped because:

```
✗ Market regime: VOLATILE (0.70 threshold)
✗ Trend confluence: LOW (< 0.4)
✗ Macro risk: HIGH (exposure 0.10)
✗ Combined confidence: INSUFFICIENT

Market cap alone doesn't guarantee execution!
The bot uses MULTIPLE factors:
  1. Market conditions
  2. Confidence thresholds
  3. Trend confluence
  4. Macro factors
  5. Risk assessment
```
